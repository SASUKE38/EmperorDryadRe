# About:
This mod allows the player to do Zethino's love test in the Circus of the Last Days with the Emperor if his romance arc was completed. Most answers to the second question can only be unlocked after learning about the Emperor's past.

# Installation:
The mod can be installed with the in-game mod manager by placing the .pak file in your \AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods folder and then activating it in-game.
The Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager should work as well.
